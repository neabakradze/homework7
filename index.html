	   	<img class="box3-image" src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lAaXwc3cegU/maxresdefault.jpg">
	   	<p class="box3-text">Racist tweets.Messy divorces.Sketchy social media advertising practices.Accusation of hacking.No,I'm not talking about the current players in American politics-I'm talking about the youtube community</p>
	   	<p class="box3-text2">Some people get fame and succsesful career in a day with one video that blew up and started trending.For e.g Jake Paul,Emma Cemberlain...Well a lot of people who got popular overnight lost it as fast as they got it.People in 21st century are looking at celebreties like they have to be perfect,and when a youtube influencer makes a mistake they get canceled right away</p>
	   	<p class="box3-text3">For e.g Jeffree Star(beauty guru) got called out by people because of his old racist tweets that were made 10 years ago.Some started to hate Jeffree but some listened to what he got to say about ten years old tweets.He said that this was a self defence machinism when others would bully him because of his sexuality.Jeffree said that he changed and became a better person.Now he has an amazing and loyal fanbase.This drama was forgotten cause people really do change and apalogy should always be taken.But when a person makes a mistake on purpose that unforgivable.We can say that in this communty scamming fans has been a loved trend.Some deny and say that the companies even scammed them but the purpose of this isnt to hate on youtubers its about the fact that mistakes can always be forgiven and when a person is honest with their fanebase ,people will always be on their side. </p>
